Basic Data Analysis

1. Analysis

Tools for analysis are based on the underlying data structure and content

open and review the data file to observe structure and content

extract data file to C:\\student

2. nucl.dat

% or fraction of nuclear stations among a group of 12 countries

no time axis

this is not trend data 

Q. Avg # 
   Total #
   Country with most   
   Country with least
   
3. Average:

use mean function to calculate the average 

nucl$V2 = display figures for that particular column only

Why was the mean and median different? Sample set was draw from countries with hugely different sizes. energy needs are larger in US than south Korea.

mean = 35, median = 22.5, min = 9, max = 119, total = 427.

display with pie chart: label and colour

slices <- nucl$(V2)
lbls <- nucl$(V1)
pie(slices, labels = lbls,col=rainbow(length(lbls)) main="Pie Chart of Countries with Nuclear Power Stations")

Task: Source some fractional data with labels and 15 rows of data

plot using pie

obtain summary stats

Bar Plot:  

4. SIRD.dat

This is the weight in KG's of 50 babies born in some hospital, no labels, no groups and no fractions or percentages here
This has floating point data elements, contains continuous data, not discrete data elements.
No time element, therefore no trend data 

birth <- scan('SIRD.data')
